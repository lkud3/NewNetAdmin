# NewNetAdmin
This is my little project in building and configuring the Network Operating System

The key idea of this project is to learn the basic use of PacketTracer software for building and configuring the network topologies. 
The result of this work is a fully operational network consisting of a main division with 4 branches divided not only physically using separate switches, but also using multiple VLANs for each of them. Additionally, it has a remote network that is connected via external router and can be reached by every device.
.pkt file is the main project file that can be run with PacketTracer and be investigated freely. The PDF file contains all the description of the network, including the explanation of choice of IPs assignment, all the steps of configuration of switches and routers, as well as additional configurations made for topology to work.
Additionally, two .txt files contain imported basic configurations for switches and routers that are the same for all of them. 
In the end of the report, all the credentials for each of the devices can be found.
